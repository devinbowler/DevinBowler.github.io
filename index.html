                    machine learning model using 2D convolutions and pooling techniques to achieve an 80%+ accuracy in labeling images. 
                    The trained model is then applied to unlabeled images from the dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness in recognizing 
                    and labeling animals accurately.</p>

                    NEAT Python library for implementing the logic. The premise of the project revolves around a car on a racetrack, 
                    where the car is equipped with sensors that reach out a certain distance and halt upon hitting the wall of the track. 
                    The neural network model associated with the car then interprets the sensor data and modifies the car's behavior accordingly. 
                    The ultimate objective is to train the car to navigate the racetrack efficiently without crashing.</p>

                        <p class="modal-text-right"><b>What is this project?</b><br><br>The Alveus Animal Detection project is a unique initiative
                             tailored for a Texas-based non-profit organization, Alveus, which focuses on broadcasting live streams featuring a
                              variety of animals. The organization uses these streams to share the stories of these creatures, raising awareness
                               about their importance and the ill-treatment many of them face. The project involved creating an innovative solution
                                for the Twitch extension they use, which displays informative cards about the animals on screen when prompted.
                                 A program was developed that is capable of accurately predicting the animal present in a frame from the live stream. 
                                 This was achieved by training a Mask R-CNN model on a generic animal-based dataset. Upon identifying and labeling all 
                                 animals within a frame, the program automatically prompts the Twitch extension to display the relevant information.</p>

                              of how Mask R-CNN models can be utilized to perform complex image segmentation and object detection tasks.
                               The project also provided a chance to work with Detectron, a state-of-the-art platform for object detection
                                research, and the iNaturalist dataset, a large-scale biodiversity dataset. Additionally, it involved leveraging
                                 the Twitch API to interact with the streaming platform. These experiences underscored the potential of
                                  integrating machine learning with web technologies to create innovative solutions that can significantly

                            This broadened understanding of the interplay between front-end and back-end technologies and underscored the 
                            importance of security and data management in application development. The Quantumix project reinforced the 
                            idea that well-crafted full-stack applications can significantly enhance productivity and work management for users.</p>

                        <p class="modal-text-right"><b>What is this project?</b><br><br>The Tic Tac Toe AI project served as an introductory 
                            exploration into the realm of Artificial Intelligence, particularly focusing on adversarial search algorithms. 
                            In this scenario, two entities are pitted against each other, with one aiming for a positive outcome (1) and the 
                            adversary aiming for a negative outcome (-1), thus lessening the first entity's outcome. The project uses a 
                            Breadth-First Search algorithm enabling the AI to evaluate the current state of the game board, assess all 
                            potential paths the game could take, and subsequently select the most beneficial option. This entire process 
                            is visualized using Python and Pygame, where the player engages in a game against a perfectly playing AI.</p>

                            and application of adversarial search algorithms in AI. The exploration into Breadth-First Search algorithms provided 
                            a deeper understanding of how AI can evaluate and make decisions based on current and potential future states. The 
                            project highlighted the intricacies of AI decision-making processes in a competitive environment. Moreover, the usage 
                            of Python and Pygame for visualization purposes further reinforced the importance of user-friendly visual 
                            representations when showcasing complex AI processes. The Tic Tac Toe AI project underscored the power and 
                            potential of AI in creating optimal strategies and decision-making processes.</p>

                             initial phase, is set to be an exciting introduction to the domain of physical CAD (Computer-Aided Design) development.
                              The primary objective of this project is to design a sleek and optimal vision setup, leveraging microboard or
                               chip technology, and an attached camera. This setup will enable the wireless transmission of live video from
                                the glasses to a desktop. Once the video feed is transmitted, it will be processed to provide useful outputs
                                 or to record specific events that occur during usage.</p>
