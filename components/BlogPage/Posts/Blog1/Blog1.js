I wanted to make a first blog post, about my blog posts. I wanted to put this into my portfolio for a way of having record of my thoughts on certain topics, and show my curiosity and teachings to those who come here to get a better idea of who I am. I think the best way to show this is to read my thoughts exactly on certain topics.
</br></br>
I want to make posts about everything from takes on tech topics, abstract thinking, tech I have learned, and just general thoughts relating to my career, the tech I use, and the lessons I learn. 
</br></br>
This is not a very long post, but I just wanted to make a note about how I want to approach my posts, and a disclaimer of I am by no means a writer, and these posts will most likely not be formatted very well, and my point may not come across as well as I would hope, but I hope whoever may read these posts can take anyway a new perspective on the topics I cover, and maybe learn something about me or what I am talking about.

      appController.navigate("blogPage"); // Navigate back to BlogPage
